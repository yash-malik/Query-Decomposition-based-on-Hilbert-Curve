Important Points:
Hilbert Curve provides much better locality.

"Both the true Hilbert curve and its discrete approximations are useful because they give a mapping between 1D and 2D space that preserves locality fairly well.[4] This means that two data points which are close to each other in one-dimensional space are also close to each other after folding. The converse can't always be true." (wikipedia)
